It looks like you're working on a Streamlit-based networking application aimed at college students, designed to help them explore networking protocols across the OSI model and potentially execute related code snippets across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. Your script is a great starting point! Let’s break it down and enhance it to meet your goals of connecting computers, opening networking tools, and enabling code snippet execution.
Current State

Your code:

Uses Streamlit to create an interactive web interface.
Displays networking protocols organized by OSI layers with descriptions, steps/examples, and resource links.
Provides a sidebar for layer selection.
Goals to Address

Connect 2 or more computers together: Your app currently doesn’t handle network connections between machines.
Open networking tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux: You mention commands/tools (e.g., ifconfig, ping), but there’s no mechanism to launch them.
Copy and run code snippets in these environments: You provide examples (e.g., Python socket usage), but there’s no way to copy or execute them yet.
Suggestions for Enhancement

Here’s how we can evolve your app to meet these objectives:

1. Connecting Computers
To connect computers, you could simulate or facilitate peer-to-peer communication:
Approach: Use Python’s socket library to create a simple server-client model within the app. Students could run the app on their machines, connect to a shared network, and exchange messages or data.

Implementation:

Add a "Connect" section where users input IP addresses or hostnames.
Use socket to establish a basic TCP/UDP connection.
Display connection status in Streamlit.
